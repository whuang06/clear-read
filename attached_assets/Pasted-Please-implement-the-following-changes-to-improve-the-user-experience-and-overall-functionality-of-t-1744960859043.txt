Please implement the following changes to improve the user experience and overall functionality of the app. First, after the text is chunked, the user should be taken directly to the lesson without needing to manually click “New Reading” or perform any additional actions. The transition into the lesson should be automatic and seamless. For the reading progress, a clear progress bar should be displayed to visually represent how much of the reading has been completed. This bar should update in real-time as the user moves through each chunk. Additionally, the chunk numbering must always remain visible regardless of whether the chunk is currently selected or not. Right now, the numbers tend to blend in with the background when clicked—this needs to be fixed using a contrasting or persistent color for clarity.

The performance section also needs refinement. Once a user completes a lesson, the analytical graph shown should be a bar graph that visually represents their progress over time. Just below the reading progress bar, there is a section displaying performance—this should reflect the user’s live average score, updating dynamically with each chunk submission. To ensure a guided learning flow, all reading sections should be locked by default. A section should only unlock after the previous one has been completed and the user has clicked “Submit.” A locked icon should be displayed next to any unavailable section to make this clear.

Additionally, replace the original “Metric” label with the word “Simplified,” and use it to show how much the text has been adjusted in complexity based on the user’s interactions. The simplification percentage should increase if the chunk is being simplified, decrease if not, and remain at 0% if no simplification is applied at all. This should be displayed prominently and clearly. Finally, introduce a color-coded difficulty indicator for each chunk: green for low difficulty, orange for medium, and red for high. These updates should all be fully implemented and integrated smoothly into the interface for a cohesive and intuitive user experience.
